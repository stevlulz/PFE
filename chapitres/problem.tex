\section{context of the project}
In recent years,  wireless  sensor network,has received much attention  of  researchers,One of the main pervasive problems WSN
encounter is  to maintain  flawless communication sharing  and  cooperative 
processing between sensors  via  radio  links to  ensure a  reliable  treatment  of 
information.Many  applications  based  on  these  WSNs consider local  clocks  at  each  sensor node  that  need  to  be  synchronized  to  a  common  notion  of  time.
In  this  context,the  majority  of  previous  researches were focused  on  the  study  of  protocols,  and algorithms   that   address   these issues   in   order   to   resolve  synchronization problems. Previous  fforts and empirical  studies  in WSN proposed several solutions (algorithms). 
The focus of this thesis is to implement a tiny-small C-library that helps motes to run operations that deals with big numbers .

\section{Objectifs}
The main objective of this project is to implement a small portable library written in C for arbitrary precision arithmetic on integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers.  It aims to provide the possible arithmetic for all applications that need higher precision,numbers than is directly supported by the basic C types.\\
Features : 
 \begin{itemize}
	\item Integers and decimals
	\item smaller perhaps Faster,easier to use than other c libraries(Lite Version)
	\item No dependencies
	\item No Dynamic Allocation
	\item Comprehensive documentation 

\end{itemize}
